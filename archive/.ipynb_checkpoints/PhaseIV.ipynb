    "**Research question: What is the relationship between the popularity of Pitbull and unemployment rate in the United States? Could we use Pitbull popularity as a predictive model and thus a recession index?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitbull, a Cuban-American artist, has been a colorful character in American music history, with a peak in the late aughts and early 2010s-- overlapping with the Great Recession. Here, we wanted to examine if we could utilize this interesting overlap to evaluate seemingly unrelated datasets to create some interesting findings. Through tracking his popularity through readily available Billboard Hot 100 data and US economic health through federal unemployment data, as well as supplementing these datasets with Wikipedia award data and Google Trends data, we aimed to see if there were statiscally significant findings relating to his success in the US and abroad and create a sort of Pitbull recession index.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at Latin awards separately as well since Pitbull is a Cuban-American artist, whose music appeals greatly to the Latin American population, particularly because a lot of his music is in Spanish. Therefore, we think that Latin awards could capture Pitbull's popularity better than American awards, given that a lot of his songs and albums qualify for Latin awards but not necessarily American awards. Moreover, various sources, including Quora and Wikipedia, claim that the Hot 100 chart is measured differently accross time in order to keep up with consumer trends, but mainly consists of factors such as sales, streaming, and radio airplay, though the exact weight assigned to each factor is kept secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many peculiar recession indexes, such as the lipstick index, where people making small purchases, like a lipstick, at a lower frequency indicates the beginning of an economic downturn. Similarly, we wanted to see if people enjoyed his music more or less as the U.S. was experiencing economic downturn, and if we could dissect it by race or ethnicity, age, and time. Ultimately, we did not create a recession index, with our main findings lacking statistical significance for the most part, though when using Google search term popularity for 'Pitbull', we find statistically significant coefficients with a positive relationship between the unemployment rate and Pitbull popularity. Particularly, we look at the years 2009-2012 for Billboard Hot 100 mentionings of Pitbull and Wikipedia awards charts for Pitbull, given that Pitbull started to see his big debuts in 2009 and he last won an award in 2012. For Google Search Term trends of Pitbull, we are able to look at the years 2009 through 2021, since there's interest index data points for all of those years. Federal unemployment data spans for all years of interest, including 2021.\n"

    "Our data consists of csv files from Kaggle, noting unemployment data and Billboard Hot 100 data. Additionally, we underwent webscraping to collect Wikipedia data on Pitbull's billboard awards.The unemployment data we needed to remove NaN values and bound the dates in between 2009 and 2012. Additionally, we needed to merge the month and date columns so we could do a time series. The same could be said for the Billboard Hot 100 file, because we needed to merge the month and the data. We also had to make sure that the only artist we accounted for was Pitbull. The Pitbull awards data scraping involved using two Wikipedia tables to create a fuller picture of how successful he was according to the Billboard awards. This meant that we added an additional column regarding whether or not the award won was for the Billboard Latin Awards or the Billboard Awards. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Information\n",
    "\n",
    "- The unemployment dataset was created to keep track of unemployment rate as an economic measure; the Wikipedia page for Pitbull's Billboard awards was likely created as a general information source for the public to learn about Pitbull as an artist and public figure; we are unsure about what the motivation was for creating the Billboard Hot 100 dataset other than to keep track of which songs appear on there and how often.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although we used the unemployment dataset from Kaggle, the data is the same as in FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and is government-funded, Wikipedia pages are usually funded through indvidual donations and volunteer contributions, and we are unsure of where the funding comes from (if any) for the Billboard Hot 100 dataset from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the Billboard Hot 100 data on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs) does not explicitly mention how the data is collected, and billboard.com (listed as the provenance) does not have a way to view past weeks, this can be a source of many human errors, including missing details from a given week or inputting incorrect details from manual data input (if the input process was manual). As for the unemployment dataset, the actual collection of such data can be found here: https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm, but the main processes that would affect the recording process would be in the sample selection itself, which may result in the over-generalization of unemployment rate numbers. As for the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Pitbull), any contributor must rely on other sources of data available to be reliable in order to compile those pieces of data into one page, in this case Billboard Awards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although we are unsure of what and how preprocessing was performed on any of these datasets, we do know that data had to be transferred from a different site (FRED and Billboard) into the datasets that we downloaded, which can have various problems as discussed previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the unemployment data, people were aware of the data collection and probably expected it to be used for government purposes, which it was, though they may have not predicted it would be used to study correlation between unemployment and Pitbull popularity.\n",

Towards that end, we will calculate z-scores to find the probability that a song's award is Latin and then plot axlines on the distribution to see if the results are statiscally significant.\n",

We do this by testing the hypothesis that the coefficients on the different unemployment measures are zero, having no effect on search term popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What we're going to do*\n",
    "- Run a linear regression since the dependent variable, interest index, is discrete, ranging from 7 to 100\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why*\n",
    "- The results of a linear regression can help us visualize an interpret the relationship between the unemployemnt rate for a given month and its effect on the Google interest index. We can also look at different demographic data like age and sex and what the relationship is between those demographic categories and what effect they have on the Google interest index. In other words, as unemployment in general, as well as unemployment for certain demographics, increases, we can look at how search term popularity for Pitbull changes."

    "Ultimately, we were unable to determine anything fully solid. As we moved onto probability functions and sampling, we were unable to come up with a model that proved much of anything. Our correlation matrix was also quite weak. Nevertheless, our K-folds provide f1 scores with low std and supplied a slightly improved model when we factored in unemployment variables like age and gender when attempting to predict Pitbull's appearance on the Billboard Hot 100. Ultimately, we walked away thinking that Pitbull was not a great predictor of unemployment."

    "**Hypothesis 1:**\n",
    "Our first hypothesis regarding having the award be Latin as an indicator of unemployment proved mixed and ultimately incorrect. While the logistic regression showed Pitbull's success towards higher unemployment, it was not a great indicator, simply because we have such a small dataset and the points all clustered towards the same values because he won all the awards at the same time each year. Moreover, the cdf for the probabilities of him winig an award in a given year and the tracking of the unemployment in a given year proved inconclusive, because there was much overlap around 50% confidence. However, what was interesting was that there was a decrease in unemployment in 2012 and that same year Pitbull won the most awards, so the highest probability of his winning an award and the lowest probability of a specific unemployment rate were at the same time. The correlation matrix showed nothing of worth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed this hypothesis to evaluate the social components of Pitbull's success-- in this case with regards to success in Latin circles, and how it may influence the unemployment rate. our line of thinking followed that the relevancy of Pitbull's success with the Latin awards was that historically he's more popular with a Latin fanbase and they were also more impacted by the Great Recession-- with an increase of 2.9% overall for their unemployment, as opposed to merely 2.0% for the rest of the population. While this may have to do more with scale, we were trying to see that if he won more Latin awards, it might be an indicator of lowered unemployment and more listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2:**\n",
    "The K-folds proved more promising, because the standard deviations were lower. I think sampling with replacement was telling as we have so little data to work with and this aided us in avoiding overfitting. Nevertheless, the produced F1 scores were not the most promising, as they were middling. Here, we were trying to see if the introduction of multiple variables could predict his success on the charts. When taking age, gender, and the general unemployment rate into account, we were trying to see if we could measure his chart success in a given year and if we could improve our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "we were able to do with slightly by removing variables like sex and older demographics, and performing a second K-fold with just unemployment rate and the unemployment rate of those between 20 and 24. Since Pitbull's listeners are generally younger, the thinking went that the way this demographic listened and worked may be an indicator of his success. Ultimately, though, it wasn't as statistically significant as we'd hoped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 3:**\n",
    "When utilizing data from Google Trends, which indicates the interest over time, calculated by search frequency, we find prmising results when using this interest index as a measure for Pitbull popularity. Specifically we find that unemployment rate as varied by ages 16-54, exept 20-24, has a significant relationship (at the 5% level) with Pitbull popularity, where an increase in the unemployment rate in those age brackets have a positive impact on the interest index for Pitbull. This is interesting because the largest impacts, in terms of coefficient value, fall on ages 25 and above. Even though Pitbull's music may be suitable for most age ranges 18 and above, the results suggest that people 25 and older are the ones searching for Pitbull on Google most often. This may come from tech-savviness and an older population looking up Pitbull every time they'd like to listen to one of his songs, whereas younger populations may use Youtube or other platforms directly for music listening. Overall, unemployment rate in ages 25+ have the most weight on search term popularity, and thus the interest index appears sensitive to changes in the unemployment rate for those age brackets.\n"

    "**a. Definition of popularity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our defintion of popularity is limited, given that we define popularity in terms of Billboard Hot 100 appearance, music awards information, and search frequency for the term 'Pitbull'. We rely on the data to be accurate, which may not be true, especially for the Billboard Hot 100 dataset from Kaggle, but we did not notice any obvious manipulations. Our general idea of popularity is most closely related to how often people listen to Pitbull, and how that frequency changes as the unemployment rate changes. Since we do not have access to such data, we found the datasets we used to be the most reasonable, though by no means precise. Additionally, when evaluating awards as a measure of popularity, we do so by choosing awards that are Latin since Pitbull, producing mainly Latin-American music, is more likely to be a recipient of those Awards because that is his category, regardless of U.S. popularity. Awards seem to also reflect delayed popularity rather than an instant measure of it, since the process of awareness of the songs/albums, to nomination, to announcement of winning all take long and may not reflect people's perception of Pitbull at the time the award is given or nominated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Timespan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Billboard Hot 100 analysis, that dataset only included information on 3 years, 2009-2012, which is a small timeframe, particularly for significant changes in the economy, specially unemployment rate. Therefore, such analyses may not be reflective of Pitbull's popularity trend overall (2009-2022), since an artist's career tends to flourish as time passes from their most significant debut (2009 for Pitbull).\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Measure of unemployment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Though FRED is a reliable source of U.S. economic data, used by policymakers, economists, researchers, etc., the way unemployment is calculated is incredibly complex, surveying different cohorts of households at different points in time, with limits on how many times any given household may participate in the survey. Moreover, unemployment only measures a small fraction of the U.S. population, surveying about 60,000 households (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/02/18/what-does-the-unemployment-rate-measure/). Thus, measures of unemployment may not be entirely reflective of U.S. economic health, compared to inflation and interest rates, but we chose unemployment because of its individual-based influence on the data (employment status) vs. other measures, like inflation and itnerest rates, which are far more influenced by larger corporations as a whole, policy changes, banks, etc., who do not have an obvious relationship with Pitbull popularity since they cannot 'listen' to Ptibull."

    "The above logistical regression reveals that for every Latin award, the unemployment rate decreases by -0.41439679. Nevertheless, this is countered by the many more no awards, which increases the numbers a lot more. Additionally, all of the \"yes awards\" are clustered tightly around certain unemployment rates, because they were all released at the same time. What I was thinking about the relevancy of Pitbull's success with the Latin awards was that historically he's more popular with a Latin fanbase and they were also more impacted by the Great Recession-- with an increase of 2.9% overall for their unemployment, as opposed to merely 2.0% for the rest of the population. While this may have to do more with scale, we were trying to see that if he won more Latin awards, it might be an indicator of lowered unemployment and more listening."

    "Ultimately, we do see some overlap in 2009, 2010, and 2011 between these two sets of probabilities, however, since these probabilities are clustered towards the mean, it doesn't mean we have any significant confidence interval. Nevertheless, towards our hypothesis, we do also see an increased probability of Pitbull receiving more Latin awards in 2011, and a decrease in unemployment. While this isn't incredibly statisically significant, I think it does speak to an improving economy and more Latin support for Pitbull's music. However, I don't want to emphasize this too much, because Pitbull recieved slightly fewer awards in 2011, and the economy did not improve significantly. The probabilites show very weak correlation, because they are very much clustered around the mean."
