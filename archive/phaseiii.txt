Our initial exploratory data analysis revealed a lot of variation, but we believe that given select factors, we can find some correlation between Pitbull's success as an artist as indicative of unemployment trends in from 2009-2012.

**Hypothesis #1**

There's a correlation between an award in a given year being Latin and the unemployment rate fluctuating by a certain amount from 2009 to 2012. In other words, the likelihood of Pitbull receiving a Latin award depends on the U.S. unemployment rate, where beta on unemployment does not equal zero.
- We will perform a logistic regression where the dependent variable = 1 for receiving a Latin award and 0 otherwise
- We will also perform a pmf on the probability that given a song's award is Latin, the unemployment rate would fluctuate by a certain amount.
- We will also utilize a correlation matrix.

**Hypothesis #2**

Given a host of variables in our unemployment data-- age range of those unemployed, their gender, and the cumulative unemployment rate-- we can predict whether or not Pitbull would make it onto the Billboard Charts. In other words, the likelihood of Pitbull having a song in the Billboard Hot 100 depends on the unemployment rate, where beta on unemployment is greater than 0.
 - We will do a train-test split logistical regression to see if we can train the data set on unemployment-- given a host of variables-- to see if we can predict Pitbull's chart success.

**Questions for reviewers:**

- How do we utilize the awards df better? Is a pmf function the best course of action, or should we utilize something else?
- Instead of a train-test split, should we utilize K-folds for hypothesis #2, because our data set is so small?
